#ES2015

###Introduction

ES2015 is the 6th edition of ECMAScript and largest upgrade to JavaScript since its creation.

###History

In 1995, there was something called the browser wars. Netscape and Microsoft were going head to head rapidly expanding their Web browsers' capabilities and features. JavaScript was developed in just ten days by Brendan Eich at Netscape. Its primary goal was to be a lightweight interpreted language for non-programmers. To keep up, Microsoft later adopted the language, calling their version JScript. By 1997, JavaScript was in every browser and used by millions. The specification was then standardized by an international standards organization, ECMA International. Because Netscape owned the name JavaScript, Netscape and Microsoft agreed upon the name ECMAScript. ECMAScript and JavaScript are the same, and you'll hear them used interchangeably.

By the end of 1999, ECMAScript 3 was standardized. It introduced things like regular expressions and exception handling. Then in late 2009, ECMAScript 5 introduced a number of useful features to the language. This version made JSON a first-class citizen with the addition of several methods that made using JSON a lot easier.

Most importantly, JavaScript is the only programming language native in web browsers. That's the main reason it's becoming such a commonly used language. Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Firefox, and Google's Chrome web browsers are rapidly adopting ES2015 features.

Because not all browsers yet support ES2015, we can lean on tools like Babel to transpile our ES2015 code into ES5 code for browsers.
